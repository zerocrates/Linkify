# Linkify #
## A plugin for Omeka ##

An exceedingly simple plugin to make Omeka automatically create links so users
can browse all the items with the same metadata values as an item they're
currently viewing.

The code here enables auto-linking for the Dublin Core Creator and Subject
elements only, but adding linking for additional elements or making the linked
elements user-configurable would be trivial.
